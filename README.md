# INTRODUCTION TO JAVA

## WHAT IS **JAVA** ?
**Java** is a *general-purpose, class-based*, ***object-oriented programming language*** designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. 

## HISTORY OF JAVA
* The **Java** language was initially called OAK.
* Originally, it was developed for handling portable devices and set-top boxes. Oak was a massive failure.
* In 1995, Sun changed the name to **"Java"** and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning www (World Wide Web) development business.
* Later, in 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took **ownership of three key Sun software assets: Java, MySQL, and Solaris**.
